# madlibs
A Mad Lib program in Javascript. Content written with young Korean English learners in mind.

I don't think there are any issues with the code, but the mechanics of the program occasionally have a flaw--sometimes a plural noun should be specified but isn't, or I need to put a verb in the past tense, or something like that.
